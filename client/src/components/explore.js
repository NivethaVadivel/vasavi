              <p>
              Vasavi Kanyaka Parameshvari is a Hindu goddess, primarily revered by the Komati community of Andhra Pradesh.She is primarily recognised by her adherents as a virgin form of Parvati, and sometimes also identified as a form of Lakshmi in Vaishnava tradition.
              </p>
              <p>
              According to legend, a powerful Chalukya monarch called Vishnuvardhana ruled Andhra in the 11th century CE. During this period, a prominent Vaishya named Kusuma Sreshti lived at Penugonda, under the king's domain. Due to his wisdom, the king treated the man like a chieftain. Due to his childlessness, the merchant prayed to Virupaksha, who blessed him with a son, Virupaksha, as well as a daughter, Vasavi, who grew up to become a comely and pious maiden. She caught the attention of the king, who wished to marry her. Despite the fact that her parents objected to the match, they could not dissuade the king of his desire. On the day of her wedding, the bride, her parents, as well as all the leaders of the community's 102 gotras showed their opposition by leaping into the homam fire, performing the act of agni pravesham. After her death, Vasavi's soul was sanctified at Penugonda, and elevated to the status of a deity.
